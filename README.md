# Sorting-Techniques

### Sorting
  [Dictionary](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/sorting): The process by which sedimentary particles become separated according to some particular characteristic, as size or shape.
  
  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting): Sorting refers to ordering data in an increasing or decreasing fashion according to some linear relationship among the data items..
  
  ` Still Confuse? well, Sorting is arragning something with respect to some manners.`
  > For example:
   I Want to arrange some numbers in accending order. Here the word number refers to something and Accending refers to some manner. 
   Now 1,2,3,4,5 is the arrangment of numbers in accending order. make sense?
   
   
   


| Comparsion Based Sort | Index Based Sort |
| :---: | :---: |
| Bubble Sort ```O(n^2) ```| Count Sort```O(n) ``` |
| Insertion Sort ```O(n^2) ``` |  Bucket/Bin Sort```O(n) ```|
| Selection Sort  ```O(n^2) ```| Redix Sort```O(n) ``` |
| Heap Sort ```O(nlogn) ```|  |
| Merge Sort ```O(nlogn) ```|  |
| Quick Sort ```O(nlogn) ```|  |
| Tree Sort ```O(nlogn) ```|  |
| Shell Sort```O(n^3/2) ``` |  |


## Creteria For Sorting Algorithm Analysis

1. Number of Comparsion
